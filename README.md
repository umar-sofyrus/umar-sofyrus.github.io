# Testing Website Project

## Overview
This project is a simple testing website that demonstrates the use of HTML elements such as iframes, select boxes, input fields, and buttons. It serves as a platform for experimenting with user interactions and displaying dynamic content based on those interactions.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

- **index.html**: The homepage of the website. It contains links to other HTML files, including those with nested iframes and simple iframes. It also includes basic elements like select boxes, input fields, and buttons, along with functionality to display text based on user interactions.

- **iframe_page.html**: This page features nested iframes. Each iframe contains select elements with multiple options, input fields, and hoverable buttons. When a user selects an option or enters text, a line of text appears to indicate the selection or input.

- **simple_page.html**: This page contains simple iframes and similar features as the iframe_page.html, including select boxes, input fields, and hoverable buttons. It also displays text based on user interactions without using nested iframes.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser to access the homepage.
2. Click on the links to navigate to `iframe_page.html` or `simple_page.html`.
3. Interact with the elements on each page to see how the text updates based on your selections or inputs.

## Features
- Nested and simple iframes
- Select boxes with multiple options
- Input fields for user text entry
- Hoverable buttons that enhance user experience
- Dynamic text display based on user interactions
